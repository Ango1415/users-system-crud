# Users System (a CRUD example for Python)
This is a little project to learn how to build a CRUD app with Python and a Postgres DB

Technologies:
- I worked with the library [psycopg2](https://www.psycopg.org/), for its installation you have to use the line *_pip install psycopg2_*
- As the base program language I used Python 3.9

How to run:
- To run the project you have to execute the script called *menu_app__user.py* (user-system-crud/lab_users/menu_app_user.py)
